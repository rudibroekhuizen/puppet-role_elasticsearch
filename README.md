## Overview

Puppet module to install elasticsearch.

## Module Description

This module will install elasticsearch with the kopf and kibana plugin. For the kibana plugin the url to the latest version is set. If you use the default version, the kibana webpage will display this warning 'Oops. Looks like you've upgraded from an old version'.

## Setup

### What role_elasticsearch affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,
  impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

### Setup Requirements

elasticsearch/puppet-elasticsearch

### Beginning with role_elasticsearch

* elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true
* kopf plugin: http://localhost:9200/_plugin/kopf
* kibana plugin: http://localhost:9200/_plugin/kibana

Very basic config to test if it is working. Create file test.conf and add: 

    input { stdin { } }

    output {
      elasticsearch {
        cluster => "cluster-01" 
      }
      stdout { 
        codec => rubydebug
      }

    }

Then run ./opt/logstash/bin/logstash -f test.conf.
To check if elasticsearch receive the data run:

    curl 'http://localhost:9200/_search?pretty'.
